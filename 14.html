<section>The difference between normative ethics and metaethics</section>       
                
                
<section>In meta-ethics we are concerned not with questions which are
the province of normative ethics like Should I give to famine relief?', or Should I return the wallet I found in the street?', but rather with questions about questions like these. What does the 'should' in such questions mean? Does it signal that these ques- tions are about some matter of fact? If so, then how do we justify' giving one answer rather than another? In other words, what sort of fact is a moral fact? In what sense is moral argument simply a species of rational argument? And if the 'should' does not signal that moral questions are about a matter of fact then, again, how do we justify giving one answer rather than another to such questions? In other words, what is moral argument about? What is its point or function? What is the standard against which a good moral argument is to be measured?</section>                

                
                
<section>Problem: views in metaethics are legion</section>   
                
<section>We are told that engaging in moral practice presupposes that there exist moral facts, and that this presupposition is an error or mistake akin to the error of presupposition made by someone who engages in a religious practice when there is in fact no God
(Mackie, 1977). And we are told that moral commitment involves no such error of presupposition; that moral talk happens inside a perfectly kosher practice (Brink, 1984; Blackburn, 1985a; McDoweU, 1985; Nagel, 1986).</section>     
                
<section>We are told that moral facts exist, and that these facts are ordinary facts, not different in kind from those that are the subject matter of science (Harman. 1986; Railton, 1986; Jackson, 1992). And we are told that moral facts exist, and that these facts are sui generis (Moore, 1903; McDowell, 1979; Sturgeon, 1985;
Boyd, 1988; Brink, 1989; Dancy, 1993).</section>       
                
                
<section>We are told that moral facts exist and are part of the causal
explanatory network (Railton, 1986; Boyd, 1988; Sturgeon, 1985: Brink, 1989). And we are told not just that moral facts play no role in the causal explanatory network, but that there are no moral facts at all (Ayer, 1936; Hare, 1952; Mackie, 1977; Blackburn,
1984; Gibbard, 1990).</section>                
                
                
<section>We are told that there is an internal or necessary connection
between moral judgement and the will (Hare, 1952; Nagel, 1970; Blackburn, 1984; McDowell, 1985; Korsgaard, 1986). And we are told that there is no such connection, that the connection be- tween moral judgement and the will is altogether external and contingent (Frankena, 1958; Foot, 1972; Scanlon, 1982; Railton, 1986; Brink, 1986).</section>           
                
<section>We are told that moral requirements are requirements of reason (Kant, 1786; Nagel, 1970; Darwall, 1983; Korsgaard, 1986). And we are told that it is not necessarily irrational to act immorally, that moral evaluation is different in kind from the evaluation of people as rational or irrational (Hume. 1888; Foot, 1972; Scanlon, 1982; Blackburn, 1984; Williams, 1985; Railton, 1986; Harman, 1985; Lewis, 1989).</section>                
<section>We are told that morality is objective, that there is a single 'true' morality (Kant, 1786; Nagel, 1970; Darwall, 1983; Korsgaard. 1986; Brink, 1989). And we are told that morality is not objective, that there is not a single true morality (Aver, 1936; Mackie, 1977;
Harman, 1975, 1985; Williams, 1985).</section>                
<section><h1>Why?</h1></section>                
<section>Michael Smith> The variety is explained by the tension between two distinctive features of morality. </section>                
<section><h1>The objectivity of moral judgement</h1></section>  <section>  <p>we seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts; that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances; and that, by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover what these objective moral facts determined by the circumstances are. The term 'objective' here simply signifies the possibility of a convergence in moral views of the kind just men- tioned. Let's call this the 'objectivity of moral judgement'.</p> 
                </section>                
<section><h1>The practicality of moral judgement</h1></section>  <section>  <p>We can summarize this second feature of morality as follows: moral judgements seem to be, or imply, opinions about the reasons we have for behaving in certain ways, and, other things being equal, having such opinions is a matter of finding ourselves with a corresponding motivation to act Let's call this the 'practicality of moral judgement'.</p></section>                

<section><h1>The consequences of the objectivity of moral judgement</h1></section>  <section>  <p>we seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts; that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances; and that, by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover what these objective moral facts determined by the circumstances are. The term 'objective' here simply signifies the possibility of a convergence in moral views of the kind just mentioned. Let's call this the 'objectivity of moral judgement'.</p>       </section>            
                
<section>Metaphysically, the implication is moral realism: the view that, amongst the various facts there are in the world, there aren't just facts about (say) the consequences of our actions on the well-being of our families and friends, there are also distinctively moral facts: facts about the rightness and wrongness of our actions having these consequences. And, psychologically, the implication is thus cognitivism: the view that when we make a moral judgement we thereby express our beliefs about the way these moral facts are. In forming moral opinions we acquire beliefs, representations of the wav the world is morally.</section>  
    
    <section>  
Given the standard picture of human psychology, there is a further psychological implication. For whether or not people who have a certain moral belief desire to act accordingly must now be seen as a further and entirely separate question. </section>                

<section><h1>The consequences of the practicality of moral judgement</h1></section>             
                
<section>Psychologically, since making a moral judgement requires our having a certain desire, and no recognition of a fact about the world could rationally compel us to have one desire rather than another, our judgement must really simply be an expression of that desire, or perhaps a complicated disposition to have that desire. This is non-cognitivism. And this psychological implication has a metaphysical counterpart. </section>                
                
<section>For it seems to follow that, contrary to initial appearance, when we judge it right to give to famine relief we are not responding to any moral fact the rightness of giving to famine relief. Indeed, moral facts are an idle postulate. In judging it right to give to famine relief we are really simply expressing our desire, or disposition to desire, that people give to famine relief. It is as if we were yelling 'Hooray for giving to famine relief!' No mention of a moral fact there. Indeed, no factual claim at all. This is irrealism: the denial of the claim that there are any moral facts. But importantly it is irrealism in the form of expressrvism: the view that in making moral judgements we do not even purport to make claims about how things are morally, but rather simply give expression to our non-cognitive states.</section>    
                
                
<section><h1>The moral problem</h1></section>
                
<section>
1 Moral judgements of the form 'It is right that I X' express a subject's beliefs about an objective matter of fact, a fact about what it is right for her to do. <br>
2 If someone judges that it is right that she X» then, ceteris paribus, she is motivated to X.<br>
3 An agent is motivated to act in a certain way just in case she has an appropriate desire and a means-end belief, where belief and desire are, in Hume's terms, distinct existences.</section>    
                
<section>The apparent inconsistency can be brought out as follows: from (1), the state expressed by a moral judgement is a belief, which, from (2), is necessarily connected in some way with motivation; that is, from (3), with having a desire. So (1), (2) and (3) together
entail that there is some sort of necessary connection between distinct existences: moral belief and desire. But (3) tells us that there is no such connection. Believing some state of the world obtains is one thing, what I desire to do given that belief is quite another .</section>
