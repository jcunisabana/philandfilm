            <section>The film does not show a conspiracy to destroy the news or change it from the root. There is however an attack on the news. Let me show you what kind of attack I mean. </section>

<h1>Slow change in values</h1>
    
    
</section>   

<section>One might be tempted to think first and foremost of values as moral values. But the notion of value is more general and is best explained by other means.</section>            
            
       <section  data-background-image ="img/football.jpg" data-background-size = "cover">
           <p class="highlightred">
           Example:  values in a football match</p></section>    

            <section>If winning is the main aim of football, what has value is whatever gets us closer to such aim.</section>
            
<section>What is the main aim of a news show?
            
            <p>What gets us closer to achieving that aim<p/>
            </section>
            
<section>It seems the question wears the answer on its sleeves: the main functions of a newscast is to communicate the news.</section> 
            
<section>We have ratings to judge how good a newscast show is: ratings meassure the amount of people that keep on watching and thus the people who get what they want, that is, the news.</section> 
            
            <section>Why are ratings used to judge a show?</section>
            
            <section>Proxies
            
            <p class="fragment">When we cannot meassure X but we know that it correlates with a variable Y that be meassured we use Y as a proxy for X.</p>

            </section>
            
<section>The problem with proxies is that they can foster perverse incentives. One can maximize a proxy without caring for the original aim. The proxy stops being a proxy</section>

    <section>Gamification: "learning through a game"</section>
    <section>Instructors are bombarded with the following: "No motivation to study? Low grades? Learning problems? Make learning fun."</section>  
                    
                    
<section>The assumption behind gamification is that learning should be valued in terms of fun (as proxy or not). Why?</section>
                
                <section>Learning should not be fun.
        <p class="fragment">It should not be boring either.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p class="fragment">This is the wrong scale</p>
     </section>
            
            <section>If we care about grades then we see gamification as  good thing: it gets us closer to our ends.</section>
            
                        <section>If we care about learning we might see gamification as a bad thing: it changes the value scale.</section>
