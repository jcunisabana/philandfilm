            ANTONIO:
              We were wondering if we should leave some

           GENETICIST:
              You want to give your child the best possible
              start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection
              built-in already.  Your child doesn't need
              any additional burdens.  And keep in mind,
              this child is still you, simply the best of you.
              You could conceive naturally a thousand times
              and never get such a result.

<section>Unlike the other films we have seen, the scenario presented by this film might not present itself as unjust. Vince was unlucky; Anton was lucky. Neither cheated.  </section>            

<section>It seems that people in the film aimed at improving themselves.  They aimed at getting better. Some people might be worse off but it is a matter of chance. </section>

            Jim1:  Jim, a botanist comes upon a public execution in a small town. A military captain has lined up twenty people. He explains to Jim that they have been chosen at random from the local population, which has recently been protesting against the government. The captain offers Jim a guest’s privilege. If Jim wishes, he can select one of them and shoot him; the other nineteen will then go free. Otherwise, the execution by the captain’s henchman, Pedro, will go ahead as planned. What should Jim do?

            </section>
            
            <section>
            Jim2: Because the captain suspects him of involvement, Jim2 is asked to commit suicide to save the 20 people. What should Jim do?

            </section>
            
            <section>
            Jim3: Jim3 has lived in the area for some time and has developed a deep and lasting personal relationship with one of the townspeople. The captain, knowing of this, sadistically offers Jim a choice: either he shoots that people and the other nineteen will go free, or the other nineteen will be shot and his friend will be freed. What should Jim do?
