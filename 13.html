        If time travel was logically possible then the time traveller could return to the past and in a suicidal rage destroy his time machine before it was completed and murder his younger self. But if this was so a necessary condition for the time trip to have occurred at all is removed, and we should then conclude that the time trip did not occur. Hence if the time trip did occur, then it did not occur. Hence it did not occur, and it is necessary that it did not occur. To reply, as it is standardly done, that our time traveller cannot change the past in this way, is a petitio principii. Why is it that the time traveller is constrained in this way? What mysterious force stills his sudden suicidal rage? (Smith, 1985, 58)        </section>

<section>If you travel in time you cannot kill your own grandfather just as you cannot travel faster than the speed of light. It is a LAW of physics. You might attempt to kill your grandfather, but something will happen: the trigger jams, the poison is not effective, he survives the car accident, etc.</section>
