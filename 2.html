<h2 class="highlightred">Descartes's arguments</h2>
    
</section>

<section>Descartes's main aim in the Meditations is to use the Method of Doubt as an exercise to undertake "once in the course of my life" in order to establish "anything at all in the sciences that is stable and likely to last".</section>
                
<section><h2>"Stable and likely to last"</h2>
<p class="fragment">Why is knowledge stable and likely to last?</p>        
                
                </section>                
<section>
    
<p>Consider three of the arguments presented by Descartes in the first meditation.</p>
    
<ol>
<li class="fragment">The existence of sensory error</li>    
<li class="fragment">The dream argument</li>    
<li class="fragment">The Malicious Demon</li> </ol>
</section>
             
    <section><h1>The existence of sensory error</h1></section>            
<section><p>"Whatever I have up till now accepted as most true I have acquired either from the senses or through the senses. But from time to time I have found that the senses deceive, and it is prudent never to trust completely those who have deceived us even once."</p></section>        
              
                
    <section><h1>The dream argument</h1></section>            
                
<section><p>"As if I were not a man who sleeps at
night, and regularly has all the same experiences while asleep as
madmen do when awake â€” indeed sometimes even more improbable ones. How often, asleep at night, am I convinced of just such familiar events - that I am here in my dressing-gown, sitting by the fire - when in fact I am lying undressed in bed! Yet at the moment my eyes are certainly
wide awake when I look at this piece of paper; I shake my head and it is not asleep; as I stretch out and feel my hand I do so deliberately, and I know what I am doing. All this would not happen with such distinctness to someone asleep. Indeed! As if I did not remember other occasions when I have been tricked by exactly similar thoughts while asleep! As I think about this more carefully, I see plainly that there are never any sure signs by means of which being awake can be distinguished from being asleep. The result is that I begin to feel dazed, and this very feeling only reinforces the notion that I may be asleep."</p></section>                
     
<section><h1>The Malicious Demon</h1></section>            
                
<Section>"I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon of the utmost power
and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me. I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams which he has devised
to ensnare my judgement. I shall consider myself as not having hands or 23 eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing that I have all these things."</Section>
