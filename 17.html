    <section>This is our last film. I decided to select "El testigo" as our last film. The structure will be different.</section>        

          
                

<section> Part of what I wish to suggest today is that the problem that El TESTIGO discusses just is the problems we still face. It is as much of our history as of our future.

 On November 11, 1985, the M-19 guerrilla laid siege to the Palace of Justice. They took everyone who was inside the building as hostages: magistrates, State councillors, occasional visitors, service staff. In a manner of minutes, the army and the police surrounded the building.

The scene was like a battlefield.

The confrontation between the police, the army and the guerrilla fighters would last a whole day.

            <section>Around 5 p.m., President Betancur and his ministers, who were gathered, managed to communicate with M-19. They informed them that they were completely surrounded. If they surrendered, they promised to respect their life and submit them to a fair trial. The guerrilla fighters answered that M-19 never surrendered, but they accepted a dialogue, if the army and police stopped shooting. The response from the government was yes, but on the condition that they ceased fire first, and freed the hostages. <br>

Ultimately, they never agreed who would cease fire first.</section>

Some people, including secretaries and magistrates, are jumping over the edge from the windows. There is total confusion right now in the building where the highest courts function: the Supreme Court and the State Council.

            <section> With the Palace of Justice in flames, the troops retreated. At about 2 a.m., when the flames had gone down, a tank shot a rocket at the facade of the building  so the smoke could come out. There were no more shots that night.</section>

To forgive is to change one's personal values, that which gives sense, and so become a different person. It is more like a mystical experience that yields a religious conversion than a calculus of harms and gains.             </div>
