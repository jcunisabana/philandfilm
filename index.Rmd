Course overview 
==================

<img src="img/1.jpg" style=" padding:5px;">


 The main aim of this course is to develop language skills in academic English while at the same time studying philosophical problems *through* film. This merits the following two clarifications.

First, though part of the aim of the course is to practice English skills, this is not an English class.
Our main concern will not be Shakespeare’s tongue but rather the peculiar hybrid that communities of academics around the globe speak and write in and what we will be calling ‘academic English’. Though native and fully fluent speakers of English certainly have an advantage, there is no need to be perfectly fluent in English in order to be proficient in ‘academic English’. Everyday conversation in English may still stump you even though you are able, in ‘academic English, to deliver a live talk to an audience in your field of study, take questions from the public, and publish results in an academic journal. 

Second, there are many deep philosophical issues about film where the worries can be categorized as issues in aesthetics, that is, roughly, issues about art and beauty. Is film a form of art? In which way? How does image and sound make art in cinema? Is any long format video recording a film? What makes a film beautiful? Are Hollywood blockbusters art? In such way of approaching to the philosophy and film, the locus of attention tends to be film as a whole, the medium, rather than individual films. Such philosophical questions are about the work of art that films, in general, can or could be. We will not be dealing with such issues.

Rather, the way in which we will talk about philosophical problems in and around film is better understood if we consider doing philosophy through films. We will not be considering the medium of cinema but rather the individual films and the philosophical claims they purportedly touch upon Though philosophy in contemporary centers of learning tends to be done through reflection upon the written word of the philosophical tradition (we read what Aristotle, Aquinas, Arendt, Anscombe and others have thought and then discuss how their thinking can help our understanding today), in this module, we will consider how specific films put forward philosophical thesis for our consideration and how philosophy can be done through them. 

To achieve success in philosophy is, according to the philosopher Wilfried Sellars, to 'know one's way around' with respect to the several ways in which things hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term.  And, accordingly, we will aim to know our way around the several ways that specific films relate to topics about knowledge, reality, value, humanity and morality.  This course is an introduction to such philosophical topics and, though incomplete and superficial, it will hopefully help you acquire a taste for the moreish aspects of philosophy through film :).

#### Rough outline
Word count: 500 words

An outline in which you present the structure of how you would defend a philosophical thesis. You must use the secondary literature, offer a clear argument and (at least roughly) base it on a film. 

#### Longer video essay
10-15 minutes video

An video in which you defend a philosophical thesis.You must use the secondary literature, offer a clear argument and (at least roughly) base it on a film. 

#### **Late submissions  **


If something  happens, it is important to speak with the me. Let’s talk. We do not have to talk about your personal issues, but it is important that you get in touch with me if you find yourselves in a situation where you see you cannot fulfill the required submissions. In such cases we need to talk as soon as possible and agree upon a plan to solve the problems with respect to the class requirements. I repeat: please get in touch.

Bibliography and media
==================

In this module, you will read and listen to philosophy in preparation for the lecture.

All of the reading will come from [1000word philosophy](https://1000wordphilosophy.com/); all of the listening will come from [Philosophy Bites](https://philosophybites.libsyn.com/). Every week I will assign a specific podcast episode and one 1000word philosophy essay to go with the film.
