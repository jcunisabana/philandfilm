Course overview 
==================

<img src="img/1.jpg" style=" padding:5px;">


The main aim of this course is to develop language skills in academic English while at the same time studying philosophical problems *through* film. This merits two clarifications.

1) Though part of the aim of the course is to practice English skills, this is not an English class.
Our main concern will not be Shakespeare’s tongue but rather the peculiar hybrid that communities of academics around the globe speak and write in and what we will be calling ‘Academic English’. Though native and fully fluent speakers of English certainly have an advantage, there is no need to be fluent in English in order to be proficient in ‘Academic English’. Everyday conversation in English may still stump you even though you are able, in ‘Academic English, to deliver a live talk to an audience in your field of study, take questions from the public, and publish results in an academic journal. 

2) There are many deep philosophical issues about film where the worries can be categorized as issues in aesthetics, that is, roughly, issues about art and beauty. Is film a form of art? In which way? How does image and sound make art in cinema? Is any long format video recording a film? What makes a film beautiful? Are Hollywood blockbusters art? In such way of approaching to the philosophy and film, the locus of attention tends to be film as a whole, the medium, rather than individual films. Such philosophical questions are about the work of art that films, in general, can or could be. We will not be dealing with such issues. Rather, the way in which we will talk about philosophical problems around and in film is better understood if we consider philosophy being done through films. We will not be considering the medium of cinema but rather the individual films and the philosophical claims they purportedly develop. Though philosophy in contemporary centres of learning tends to be done through reflection upon the written word of the philosophical tradition (we read what Aristotle, Aquinas, Arendt, Anscombe and others have thought and discuss how their thinking can help us today), in this module, we will consider how specific films put forward philosophical thesis for our consideration and how philosophy can be done through them. 

To achieve success in philosophy is, according to the philosopher Wilfried Sellars, to 'know one's way around' with respect to the several ways in which things hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term.  And, accordingly, we will aim to know our way around the several ways that specific films relate to topics about knowledge, reality, value, humanity and morality.  This course is an introduction to such philosophical topics and, though incomplete and superficial, it will hopefully help you acquire a taste for the moreish aspects of philosophy through film :).
