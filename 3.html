(1) p is true.<br>
(2) S believes that p.<br>
(3) If p were false, S would not believe that p (sensitivity)<br>
(4) If S were to believe that p, p would not be false. (safety).

<h1>    Simple Causal Theory of Knowledge:</h1>
    

S knows that p iff p is true; <br>
S believes that p;<br>
Sâ€™s belief that p is caused by the fact that p.<br>

<h1>   Knowledge as primitive</h1>
    
We should not attempt to understand knowledge in terms of belief plus something else. Rather, we should attempt to understand justification and  belief, for example, in terms of knowledge.

If a clock is stopped at 2:33 and it is actually 2:33, do you come to know that the time is 2:33 by looking at the clock?<p>
